            "passage": "The sheer number of people in a group affects the amount of communication. Consider the difference between communication between two friends and communication in a group of five people. When friends talk, there are two people sending and receiving messages. In a group of five, there are five people doing the same thing. Each idea that is expressed must be understood by four others, who may also choose to respond. Consequently, the greater number of people in a group, the fewer contributions any individual may make. Because there are disadvantages to large groups, you might assume that small groups would be the most effective.  However, groups can be too small as well as too large. With a few members, a group has limited resources, which eliminates a primary advantage of groups for decision making. Also, in very small groups, members may be unwilling to disagree or criticize each other's ideas. I believe that five to seven members is the ideal size for a small group.",

There are street people - those who sleep in bus stations, parks, and other areas. Many of these people are youthful runaways. There are the so-called sheltered homeless - those who sleep in government supported or privately funded shelters. Many of these individuals used to live with their families or friends. While street people are almost always single, the sheltered homeless include numerous families with children. Conservatives argue that many homeless are alcoholics, drug users, or mentally ill. In contrast, many liberals argue that homelessness is caused by a reduction in welfare benefits and by excessively priced housing. They want more shelters to be built for the homeless.",

The author, Dr James Bruno, says that the first positive discipline technique is for parents to remain calm because nervous parents don't get good results. Parents who cannot often remain calm find that their children stop taking any notice of them. The second challenge is to know how to correct bad behavior in an effective way. For instance, punishing children by preventing them from watching their favorite TV program is not an ideal solution. Dr Bruno believes parents should establish clear rules for children to follow. If children refuse to follow these, they know they will be disciplined. Finally, the most effective way of encouraging good behavior is to give positive feedback as often as possible, to show that it is not only naughtiness that attracts attention.",

However, it is often tempting to hurry the child beyond his natural learning rate, which can set up dangerous feelings of failure and states of worry in the child. This might happen at any stage. A young child might be encouraged to learn to read before he knows the meaning of the words he reads. On the other hand, though, if a child is left alone too much, or without any learning opportunities, he loses his natural enthusiasm for life and his desire to find out new things for himself. Parents vary greatly in their degree of strictness towards their children. Some may be especially strict in money matters. Others are severed over times of coming home at night or punctuality for meals. In general, the controls imposed represent the needs of the parents and the values of the community as much as the child's own benefit.",

When humans learned to make fire, however, they became capable of altering their environment. To provide themselves with fuel they stripped bark from trees, causing the trees to die. Clearings were burned in forests to increase the growth of grass and to provide a greater grazing area for the wild animals that humans fed upon. This development led to farming and the domestication of animals. Fire also provided the means for cooking plants which had previously been inedible. Only when the process of meeting the basic need for food reached a certain level of sophistication was it possible for humans to follow other pursuits such as the founding of cities.",

The full cost of the world’s food waste could total $400 billion a year. Billions could be saved if the amount of food waste were reduced. The food thrown away by retailers and consumers in wealthy nations could feed all of the world’s 870 million hungry people. A family of four wastes about $1,600 worth of food each year. The waste numbers are all expected to grow unless steps are taken. The production of food uses vast amounts of water, land and fertilizer. Food waste in landfills creates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This gas is about seven percent of total polluting emissions worldwide. Reducing food waste can make a difference. Composting is one solution. However, there are other ways to reduce food waste. Extending expiration dates will reduce waste. Selling smaller portions of food also will reduce waste. Changes in the way food products are made may be helpful. One company changed the way it wrapped dough in the shell of its pot pies. That change saved 235 tons of dough a year. An expert said, “We need to find ways to deal with food waste, but we need to prevent it in the first place.” ",

They say productivity would go up and the number of sick days would go down. This is the debate now and in the future. A new study shows what improving air quality would do. Reducing pollution leads to better respiratory function in children ages 11 to 15. These are the most important years for lung development. The lungs you have developed at that age are the lungs you will have for the rest of your life. Scientists know that air pollution leads to smaller lung capacity and compromised breathing in children. They did not know what the effect would be on childrens’ lungs if the air quality improved. Now they know.  Researchers monitored air quality in three communities on the west coast. The study took place over a 17-year period when air quality improved.  The study measured how much air the youngsters could blow in and out of a device. It also measured lung capacity.  The study found that the lung development in the children born later in the study period (when air quality had most improved) was “more robust.” unhealthy lung function dropped from 8 percent in earlier participants to 3.5 percent in the later participants. There were no differences based on gender, race or ethnicity. The study said that clean air would increase the lifespan of people raised in those communities. ",

Both careful observation of living things and experiments are used today in the study of biology. Galen observed and described the internal anatomy of the human body.-He described many parts that he saw in the body. But he was not always careful. He sometimes described what he expected to see and did not look carefully to see what was really there.

Severe earthquakes are most common near the edges of the 'plates' in the Earth's crust, such as around the Pacific Ocean, along the mid-Atlantic ridge and in the Mediterranean and South- West Asian regions. They occur when the plates move. So earthquakes are caused by volcanic action, explosions and other factors. Earthquakes under the sea trigger off huge waves called tsunamis.",

They have had to adjust to living in remote or harsh condition. Examples are the pygmies of the Congo who have escaped into the thickest jungles which are full of dangers. They have learned to obtain a living there and to cope with wild animals. African bush men manage to live off the arid Kalahari Desert where there is hardly any other life. Life is tough for the bush men but they are left in peace. These social adaptations could well lead to biological adaptations over a number of generations, but this is a very slow progress and it is unlikely that any one person would be aware of it taking place.",

Both careful observation of living things and experiments are used today in the study of biology. Galen observed and described the internal anatomy of the human body.-He described many parts that he saw in the body. But he was not always careful. He sometimes described what he expected to see and did not look carefully to see what was really there. For centuries after Galen, people studied anatomy from his books instead of trusting their own observations.",

The only way in which they can achieve this is by raiding other colonies and seizing the larvae and pupae; they then carry them back to their own colonies and raise them as slaves. Once their slaves die, they raid new colonies, capture new larvae, and acquire a new supply of slaves. ",

Second, history teaches us what questions to ask about the present. Contrary to some people’s view, the study of history is not the memorization of names, dates, and places. It is the thoughtful examination of the forces that have shaped the courses of human life. We can examine events from the past and then draw inferences about current events. History teaches us about likely outcomes. Another benefit of the study of history is the broad range of human experience which is covered. War and peace are certainly covered as are national and international affairs. However, matters of culture (art, literature, and music) are also included in historical study. Human nature is an important part of history: emotions like passion, greed, and insecurity have influenced the shaping of world affairs.
