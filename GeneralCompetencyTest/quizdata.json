                    "passage": "Under the Taliban regime Afghan women and girls were excluded from all levels of the education system; schools were destroyed and female teachers were prevented from working. Unfortunately, nowadays many girls are still missing out because of obstacles such as early marriage and cultural norms that oppose their education (over 60% of girls remain out of schools). Girl’s schools also remain a target for Taliban attacks. Since the regime’s fall in 2001, a record number of students have enrolled, including the highest percentage (36%) of female students in decades, but significant challenges remain. Continuing conflict coupled with the lack of infrastructure and trained teachers hinder the delivery of education. In Afghanistan, an estimated 68% of schoolteachers do not have the minimum teaching qualification (source: Afghanistan Ministry of Education). Alternatively, many schools in Afghanistan do not have washing or sanitary facilities and thus girls are reluctant to attend school, especially during menstruation. Play areas and sports facilities are in disrepair and lead to little or no physical play for many girls in school. In 2008, the Government of Afghanistan laid out an ambitious 5-year strategy for a national education program. It includes commitments to construct new schools; to increase the enrolment of girls; to provide more training for teachers; and to introduce an updated curriculum. Even so, the quality of education remains in question, with benchmarks undefined and underfunded. Quality is a key to keep children at school longer and into higher levels of education. And, quality education will ultimately accelerate progress in Afghan society. Since 2007, the Womanity Foundation has supported Afghanistan’s largest girls’ school – the Al Fatah School in Kabul – to become a model of excellence in girls’ education. Based on this experience, Womanity has developed a holistic approach that focuses on the quality of education offered to girls up to secondary school.",
